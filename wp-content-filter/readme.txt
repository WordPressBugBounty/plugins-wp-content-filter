Take control and protect your site today! Censor all content containing profanity, swearing, offensive, and abusive comments. Flexible Plugin options.

== Description ==

Use this plugin to censor content on your site! Easily block out all forms of unwanted content by specifying a list of keywords to be filtered.

Flexible options include advanced control over content such as strict/non-strict filtering. Flagged keywords which are embedded in whole words can be ignored.

e.g. 'competition' will be ignored if you have 'pet' as a flagged keyword. Otherwise with strict filtering OFF it will appear as 'com***ition'.

You can also select which sections of your WordPress site to censor including:

* Posts (including recent posts sidebar widget)
* Post title
* Comments (including recent comments sidebar widget)
* Comment authors
* Tags
* Tag cloud

Keywords are replaced with wild card characters. Further options retain the first letter of each filtered keyword, remove all letters (wild card characters only), or retain the first and last letter of the filtered keyword.

e.g. The keyword pluto would be replaced with either p****, *****, or p***o. Keywords can also be filtered using case insensitive, or case sensitive options.
